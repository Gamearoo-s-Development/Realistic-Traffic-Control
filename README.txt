# Building (Dev)

This Minecraft 1.12.2 project uses an older ForgeGradle/Gradle setup which requires **Java 8**.

If you try to run Gradle with a newer JDK (ex: Java 17/21/23), you may see:
"Could not determine java version from '23.x.x'".

Use the helper script in the 1.12.2 folder:

1. Install a Java 8 JDK (Temurin 8 recommended)
2. Run: 1.12.2\gradlew-java8.bat compileJava

You can also set JAVA8_HOME to your JDK8 folder to make the script find it.
